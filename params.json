With standard chargers, charging your phone over night causes the battery to overcharge after it reaches 100%.  This overcharge is not healthy at all for the battery and reduces its capacity and performance over time.  Project Vitality solves this problem by providing a \"smart\" interface to the charger. This \"smart\" charger automatically stops sending current to the phone once it reaches 100%.  This allows the phone's battery to remain much healthier, giving users longer use of their battery over a long period of time, and a longer charge over a short period of time.  \r\n\r\nHere is a video of the product in action,\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope to expand this product to iOS and other devices, especially by improving on our initial design.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAlex Edwards - Design, Construction\r\nMatt Hughes - Design, Construction\r\nNick Kiesel - Electrical Engineering, Construction\r\nLuke Kuza - Electrical Engineering, Android and Embedded System Programming ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
