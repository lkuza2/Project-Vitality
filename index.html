<p>Project Vitality is a hardware and software based solution for Android to increase the longevity and performance of your device's battery over time.  With standard chargers, charging your phone over night causes the battery to overcharge after it reaches 100%.  This overcharge is not healthy at all for the battery and reduces its capacity and performance over time.  Project Vitality solves this problem by providing a "smart" interface to the charger. This "smart" charger automatically stops sending current to the phone once it reaches 100%.  This allows the phone's battery to remain much healthier, giving users longer use of their battery over a long period of time, and a longer charge over a short period of time.  </p>

<p>Here is a video of the product in action,</p>

<p>We hope to expand this product to iOS and other devices, especially by improving on our initial design.</p>
